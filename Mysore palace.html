            <blockquote>You cannot fathom the greatness of the Mysore Palace unless you come face to face with it. The grandness of its proportions would have you believe that the palace had sprung out of a fairytale. It was built by the British architect Lord Henry
                Irwin in 1912. Mysore Palace was built in Indo-Saracenic style and features intricate interiors. The interiors of the palace are adorned with ornate ceilings, jeweled corridors, stained glass windows and open mandaps. You also come across
                several Wadiyar memorabilia, including the jeweled throne. Mysore Palace also hosts the festivities of Dasara festival. Explore Mysore tour packages. You cannot fathom the greatness of the Mysore Palace unless you come face to face with

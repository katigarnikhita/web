                <blockquote>One of the most popular historic places in India is the Gateway of India. One of the most iconic landmarks in the country, it was built by the British in 1924. It was actually built as an entry and exit point during the British period,
                    and inaugurated by the Viceroy, the Earl of Reading. Today, however, it has become a favorite picnic spot for locals and tourists alike. On any given day, one can spot dozens of street vendors serving tasty snacks along with balloon
                    sellers, thereby lending a happening vibe to the entire place. The Gateway of India has been reinforced repeatedly over the years with yellow basalt and concrete. In addition, the turrets are decorated with delicate lattice work.

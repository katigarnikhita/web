                <blockquote><i>Looking at Agra Fort, one would get the impression that for the Mughals, opulence and grandeur were seemingly alien terms. Located in Agra, a city included in the Golden Triangle Tour Circuit India, it beautifully brings the elements of
                    aesthetics to size. The massive fort was built by Akbar in 1565 AD, and stands out for its fabulous design and incredible construction. The fort also consists of two ornately designed gates, the Amar Singh Gate and the Delhi Gate.
                    Visitors can only enter through the Amar Singh Gate. The Agra Fort, which is always included among the must visit forts and palaces in India, consists of a number of buildings like Moti Masjid, Diwn-i-Aam, Diwan-i-Khas and Musamman
                    Burj, where Shah Jahan died in imprisonment. Do you know? Agra Fort found a mention in one of the cases of the famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, “Sign of the Four”. This was also the location for the Bollywood movie, “Jodha Akbar”.
                    Don’t miss: Some of the important buildings inside the Agra Fort which you should absolutely check out are Jahangir Palace, Nagina Masjid, Moti Masjid, Mina Masjid and Zenana Mina Bazaar.

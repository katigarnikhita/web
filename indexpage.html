        </i>It’s hardly an exaggeration to say that India’s civilization is one of the oldest in the world. All throughout its history, it has witnessed the rise and fall of several kings, dynasties and empires. Each of those in power, however, left behind

        you know about the history of India? Is your knowledge about its history confined to textbooks? If yes, then this blog guide you about historical places in India. Read on!</blockquote>
